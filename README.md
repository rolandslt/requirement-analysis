# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains structured notes, examples, and resources related to the process of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
Its goal is to help students and developers understand how to gather, document, validate, and manage software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs, goals, and expectations are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation for designing and building the right software solution.

This process involves activities such as requirement elicitation (interviews, surveys, workshops), documentation (use cases, user stories), validation (ensuring accuracy with stakeholders), and prioritization (deciding which features are most important).

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Defines Project Scope**: It sets clear boundaries to avoid scope creep.
- **Improves Communication**: Aligns understanding between stakeholders and developers.
- **Reduces Errors Early**: Identifies problems before development starts, saving time and cost.
- **Guides Design & Development**: Provides a roadmap for how the system should behave.
- **Supports Testing**: Clear requirements help build effective test cases.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the success of any software development project. Here are three key reasons why it is essential in the SDLC:

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**  
   By clearly defining and documenting requirements early, teams can avoid unplanned features or changes that disrupt timelines and budgets.

2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment**  
   It helps bridge the gap between what stakeholders want and what developers build, reducing misunderstandings and improving satisfaction.

3. **Improves Quality and Reduces Costs**  
   Catching errors and ambiguities early in the requirement phase helps prevent costly changes during development or after deployment.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis process involves several important activities that ensure software requirements are clear, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs. Below are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Involves collecting high-level needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observations.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Focuses on digging deeper to understand stakeholder expectations, using techniques like brainstorming, workshops, and prototyping.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Converts gathered requirements into structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Involves evaluating, refining, and structuring requirements using tools like data flow diagrams (DFDs) and use case models.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensures all documented requirements are accurate, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders through reviews and walkthroughs.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are typically divided into two main categories: Functional and Non-functional. Below are definitions and examples based on a **booking management system** project.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do**‚Äîthe specific behaviors, functions, and interactions.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users can **register and log in** with a secure password.
- Users can **search for available properties** by location, date, and price.
- The system allows users to **make, view, and cancel bookings**.
- Admins can **add, edit, or remove property listings**.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**‚Äîthey relate to quality attributes such as speed, security, and usability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should **load pages within 2 seconds**.
- Booking data must be **encrypted during transmission**.
- The platform must be **available 99.9% of the time** (high uptime).
- The interface should be **responsive and accessible on mobile devices**.
## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are predefined conditions that a feature or functionality must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders. They serve as a checklist to determine whether the implementation meets the original requirements and is functioning as expected.

### üìå Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- ‚úÖ Clarify requirements and remove ambiguity.
- ‚úÖ Define what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means for a feature.
- ‚úÖ Guide developers and testers in implementation and verification.
- ‚úÖ Help align stakeholders on expectations and success measures.

### üí° Example: Acceptance Criteria for "Checkout" Feature in Booking Management System

**Feature**: Property Booking Checkout

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The user must be logged in to proceed to the checkout page.
- The checkout page must display property name, selected dates, and total cost.
- The user should be able to confirm the booking by clicking **‚ÄúConfirm & Pay‚Äù**.
- System must validate and process payment before booking confirmation.
- After successful payment, a confirmation message and booking reference must be displayed.
